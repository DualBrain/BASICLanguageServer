# BASIC Language Server Library

Language Server based on CXuesongâ€™s excellent Demo Language Server example.  Wraps the BASIC Language Parser, which provides the syntactic and semantic information for the diagnostic messages.

Currently (2/6/2022), Color Basic is in progress.  The Language Server is properly called from VSCode extension part of the time (1 out of 10).  Maybe having multiple Visual Studios and VS Codes open causes the output to go the wrong one?  More work is going on in the grammar and parser than the language server.
